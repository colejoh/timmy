    <h3>Around Purdue</h3>
    <p>
      Many of our service projects impact our local community in West
      Lafayette and Lafayette, IN. Current opportunities include educating
      the children at the Boys & Girls Club in conjunction with IU Health's
      Get Onboard Active Living program, collecting donations outside of
      Wal-Mart for our Ecuador Medical Brigade, helping out at Food Finders
      Food Bank, volunteering in the soup kitchen at the Lafayette Urban
      Ministry or for their other events throughout the year, participating
      in our pilot program- the Food Recovery Network, which allows us to
      donate unused food from Purdue's dining courts to facilities around
      the community, and even more! These events give students an intimate
      view of the importance public health in their own community and raise
      awareness on our organization's goals and achievements. Contact Will
      Austin, the Director of Community Service for more information.

    <h3>Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
    <p>
      Unique to the Purdue chapter of Timmy Global Health, our Domestic
      Service trip sends 16 students to Atlanta, GA over spring break.
      Working in conjunction with DOOR Atlanta, a local non-profit
      organization, we serve in soup kitchens, food pantries, after
      school programs, and learn about those struggling with homelessness.
      Starting in Spring of 2016, this trip has also had the opportunity
      to visit the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and discuss
      issues about public health with experts at the CDC. More information
      will be released at general meetings and applications will open
      early October. Contact Erin Dubin or Sukhi Kaur, the trip leaders
      for the 2018-2019 school year.

    <h3>Quito Equidor</h3>
    <p>
      On our flagship Spring Break trip, 16 students travel with medical
      professionals to underserved communities in Quito, Ecuador. This
      medical brigade is organized with Timmy Global Health Headquarters,
      as we return to the same communities each year. Combined with
      medical brigades from other college and high school chapters, this
      results in a continuity of care for high-risk, chronic patients, as
      a Timmy clinic is set up in those same communities every couple of
      months by each chapter. Leading up to the trip, trip leaders give
      lessons on Spanish, Ecuadorian culture, and host mock-clinics to
      prepare each trip goer for this amazing experience. As with the
      service trip to Atlanta, GA, more information will be released at
      general meetings and applications will open in October. Contact
      this year's trip leaders, Mikaela Skaare or Ashley Birkhimer for
      more information.
